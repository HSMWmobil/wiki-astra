# Overview

HSMWmobil is the cross-platform mobile application for students.
The app is build in the cross-platform toolkit [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and built for 
Android and iOS using the very same code base.
A guide to set up the repository with a fitting Java and Flutter version is given in the 
[repository itself](https://github.com/HSMWmobil/app).
We encourage to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to ease up the 
development process with various useful IDE and plugin functionalities.

This wiki describes the most important infrastructural joints of the app project as well as 
various special implementations one could use to extends the app.
